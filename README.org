[[https://github.com/yveszoundi/grails-projectile-mode/blob/master/LICENSE][file:http://img.shields.io/badge/license-GNU%20GPLv3-blue.svg]] [[http://stable.melpa.org/#/grails-projectile-mode][file:http://stable.melpa.org/packages/grails-projectile-mode-badge.svg]]  [[http://melpa.org/#/grails-projectile-mode][file:http://melpa.org/packages/grails-projectile-mode-badge.svg]]

This project provides useful [[http://grails.org][Grails]] support for Emacs in terms of navigation and commands execution.

* Screenshot

Below is a screenshot of =grails-projectile-mode= in action.
The menu is displayed via [[https://github.com/kai2nenobu/guide-key][guide-key]] with the flag =guide-key/recursive-key-sequence-flag=.

* Keybindings discovery support
In order to improve usability, support has been added for [[https://github.com/mickeynp/discover.el][discover.el]] when available.
This makes it easier to use commands without resorting that much to muscle memory.

You can install =discover.el= via the =package.el=, =el-get=, =Cask= or whatever other package manager
you may be using. When =discover.el= is found in the Emacs =load-path=, support for it will be enabled
automatically. To use the default keybindings =grails-projectile-keymap-prefix= value, followed by the =d=
character (=C-c ; d= is the original value), add this to your =init file=.

=(grails-projectile-discover-setup-keybindings)=.

Below is a screenshot of this feature.

* Grails Code completion information

- Eclim [[https://github.com/ervandew/eclim/issues/25][now supports Groovy]] , you'll need the [[http://eclim.org/install.html][latest Eclim]] for that.
- I have a [[https://github.com/yveszoundi/emacs-eclim][modified version of emacs-eclim]] to hook groovy code completion.

* Dependencies installation

It is recommended to use the [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA][package system]] to install dependencies.
You'll likely want to start with =groovy-mode=.
** Set-up
After installation, add 
=(require 'grails-projectile-mode)=
=(grails-projectile-global-mode t)=

to automatically enable this minor mode.
** Projectile
[[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/][Projectile]] is a nice way to manage projects in Emacs.
=M-x package-install projectile [RET]=

** Groovy mode
[[https://github.com/Groovy-Emacs-Modes/groovy-emacs-modes][Groovy-mode]] brings you Groovy syntax highlighting.
=M-x package-install groovy-mode [RET]=

* Commands
** Minor mode prefix
The default key prefix is =C-c ;=. This can be changed by
customizing the =grails-projectile-keymap-prefix= variable.

** Interactive commands

Below is the list of available interactive commands.
