#+TITLE: Emacs Grails Projectile Mode

[[http://stable.melpa.org/#/grails-projectile-mode][file:http://stable.melpa.org/packages/grails-projectile-mode-badge.svg]]  [[http://melpa.org/#/grails-projectile-mode][file:http://melpa.org/packages/grails-projectile-mode-badge.svg]]

This project provides useful [[http://grails.org][Grails]] support for Emacs in terms of navigation and commands execution.

* Features

- You can run pre-defined or arbitrary Grails commands for a project with easy shortcuts.
- You can browse documentation (main documentation page, guide, apidocs).
- Custom JVM options to pass to the Grails command are supported at a global level.
- Custom command line options to pass to Grails by default.
- You can use the Grails wrapper by default whenever available for a project.
- For grails-projectile, customization group called *grails-projectile* that is accessible via =M-x customize-group=.
- Lookup functions are available to quickly visit controllers, services, etc.
- Menubar contributions for common commands.
- You can create a =.grails-projectile= file at the root of the project for default project specific JVM options.

* Related - Code completion
- Eclim [[https://github.com/ervandew/eclim/issues/25][now supports Groovy]] , you'll need the [[http://eclim.org/install.html][latest Eclim]] for that.
- I have a [[https://github.com/yveszoundi/emacs-eclim][modified version of emacs-eclim]] to hook groovy code completion.
- TODO -> Add a screenshot and a Youtube video.

* Dependencies installation

It is recommended to use the [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA][package system]] to install dependencies.
You'll likely want to start with =groovy-mode=.

** Projectile
[[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/][Projectile]] is a nice way to manage projects in Emacs.
=M-x package-install projectile [RET]=

** Groovy mode
[[https://github.com/Groovy-Emacs-Modes/groovy-emacs-modes][Groovy-mode]] brings you Groovy syntax highlighting.
=M-x package-install groovy-mode [RET]=

* Commands
** Minor mode prefix
The default key prefix is =C-c ;=. This can be changed by
customizing the =grails-projectile-keymap-prefix= variable.

** Interactive commands

Below is the list of available interactive commands.
